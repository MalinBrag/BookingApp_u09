### Sarah Johansson, 28 (Yoga instructor and personal trainer)
- **User Story 1**:  
  As a website user, I want it to be visually soothing and with an obvious flow, so I can quickly search and book flights. 
  I want to enter my passport details only once during registration, so I can save time and enjoy a hassle-free experience each time I travel, since I travel quite much. And since I do, I know that I usually get alot of info sent to my email, so I dont know which emails are actually important for my booked flights! I can easily get overwhelmed with that.
  I would prefer if I could receive notifications in my website account, in a "my messages" function, that ONLY contains relevant info like flight updates or changes.
  

### David Andersson, 55 (IT manager)
- **User Story 2**:  
  As a website visitor, a busy manager and family man, I want a reliable and easy-to-navigate booking site that allows me to check flight rates often. I have a big family so I need to book as cheap as possible. 
  If I could have the flight search saved on the front page, then I could just update the main page a few times a day to see if the rates are going up or down. But then I call the airline directly to book, because I would like to speak to a person when I do that.


### Karin Bergstr√∂m, 67 (Retired teacher)
- **User Story 3**:  
  As a website user and retired teacher, I want a simple, easy-to-understand booking site where I can search for flights at my own pace and book direct flights. 
  I dont want complicated travels with waiting around time at big airports, or stressful flight changes while my luggage gets lost.
  I prefer only the necessary information to be displayed on my flight details, so that I feel at ease during the booking process and can focus on enjoying my travel plans. I would however like to know relevant info like departure and arrival terminals, so that I can book a taxi a few days in advance.
  The website needs to feel friendly and personal for me to feel safe.
